# GeoLocator
Android Application to locate a given GeoPoint on Google Maps with functionality of current location is enabled.<br>
This application is showing marker at LNMIIT Jaipur which can be changed to any position depending upon the values of latiitude and longitude.
I have used green color marker but it can be changed to various colors like red,blue etc.
